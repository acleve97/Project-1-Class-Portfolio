   <b>Andrea's Weekly (2/5/23)</b><br>
   Song of the week: 4/4 - Danny and Alex<br/>
   <br>
  I had a very busy week again.
  Starting off the week, I worked on our exercises and
  thought about what I would like to work on for our 
  first project. During the creation of our poem variation,
  I realized I had trouble formatting how the page would appear on different devices.
  This is something to pay better attention too. I'm feeling a bit nervous with our firs project,
  as I wonder how I'll be able to pull off my idea. My idea is to create a galaxy web aesthetic.

  Outside of classes, I learned how to give my pet cat Desmond injections. 
  It's a long story, but he got an ultrasound recently, confirming either Irritable Bowl Disease or Acute Lymphoma.
  I decided to start him on a B12 shot along with prednisone medications. Over the week, he's started feeling a lot better,
   and hopefully he'll start gaining the weight he needs. This has been a great source of anxiety for me so this makes <b>me</b>
   feel a lot better too.
