   <b>Andrea's Weekly (2/12/23)</b><br>
   Song of the week: Sunday Best - Valiant Vermin, Ricky Montgomery<br/>
   <br>
I spent all week modeling for my 3D Modeling class. I had a lot A LOT to do. I can't think of much that happened this week despite
trying to remember. I spent a lot of time super tired as well, and just wanting to rest. We started working on our first project here
in class and its a bit overwhelming, but hopefully I'll get a good head start on coding this upcoming week. I think my initial idea may be 
too large for my skill level right now, so I'm thinking of simplifying my idea.
<br><br>
  Outside of classes, I stayed tuned to the news about East Palestine, Ohio. It's a shame a tragedy like this could have been avoided
  if rail workers weren't stopped from going on strike. I hope those responsible get properly called out for it, and that Norfolk Southern gives the townsfolk
  of East Palestine more than $25,000 for the damage they caused and the lives they've impacted. My heart goes out to the people who lost their pets, livestock, and
  I wish them well.
