      <b>Andrea's Weekly (3/19/23)</b><br>
      Song of the week: Grow - HOAX<br/>
      <br>
      This week was spring break, and I worked on exercise 4 with JavaScript. I kept it relatively simple and easy. I wanted to work within a color scheme and liked the warm palette I used.

      In other news, I visited my friends in Dayton one day during break. It was nice to see them as itâ€™s rare we can all get together. Other than that, my spring break was spent resting because I needed it. 
      
      I was a bit overwhelmed by the sheer capacity of what is available with JavaScript, and I hope to understand it better. Also who allowed the cold weather this week??
