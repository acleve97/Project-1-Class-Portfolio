   <b>Andrea's Weekly (3/6/23)</b><br>
   Song of the week: Someone Else's Dream - Absofacto<br/>
   <br>
   <br>
This week was crazy. CRAZY busy. This upcoming week is proving to be busy too, but spring break looms in the distance. I can't wait. I want to catch up on school work and better improve my project 1.
Outside of classes, It was my birthday week. I didn't do anything for the occassion because when you're get older all you want is peace and relaxation. Plus the weather didn't help, haha.
My birthday was on Friday (3/3) and I forgot my umbrella so I got soaked. Other than that, my mom got me an ipad as a present. Thanks, Mom!

  I'm in charge of class discussion this week!
