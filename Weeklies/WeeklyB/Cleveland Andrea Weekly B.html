<p>Continuing off our workshops so far in the semester, we were given two assignments this week.<br>
 It was a super busy week for me. I had a 3D Modeling assignment due and another due in a few days.<br>
 It's been difficult keeping up with all of the busy tasks I have to do, but I'm working through it<br>
 On my last weekly I mentioned problems with images but I finally was able to get an image inserted.<br>
 Yay for progress! My goal for the next week is to feel proud of the small assignments we were given. <br>

<p>During this weeks discussion what I found most interesting was Olia Lialina's article.<br>
It talked about user experiences, and we had discussed in class what sites we've had great user experiences on.<br>
Personally, one of the most fun experiences I've had on any website I can remember was when I was in middle school,<br>
there was this site called iscribble, where I would roleplay and draw with others. Olia's article really reminded me, <br>
how great experiences can be.<br>
