 <b>Andrea's Weekly (3/26/23)</b><br>
 Song of the week: The Wolf - Miniature Tigers <br/>
 <br>
Back from Spring Break. It went by toooo fast. We had our first class going over our 4th exercise. I wish I could have done more with it but I wanted it to be straightforward.
<br>This week we had a workshop with functions, parameters, and iteration. We're getting ready to do exercise five. I'm still working on fixing up our first project site.
