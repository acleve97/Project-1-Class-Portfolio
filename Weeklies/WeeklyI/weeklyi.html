 <b>Andrea's Weekly (4/16/23)</b><br>
 Song of the week: NO PAIN - Silica Gel <br/>
 <br>
Started working on our final project. I'm attempting to do a snowy scene with a small house. I just hope the snow fall works correctly, as I'm layering all of the components.
This week I helped my sister get out all of our outdoor patio furniture for the warm weather. Last year I grew cherry tomatoes, but they got so large and crazy and toooo big for my small patio.
I'm gonna keep it to flowers. Got any suggestions?
