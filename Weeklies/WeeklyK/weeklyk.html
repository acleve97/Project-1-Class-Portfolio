 Song of the week: The American Dream is Alive in Mexico - Mood Beach<br/>
 <br>
A full class reflection. Overall? I could have done better but I felt very spread thin by my class schedule, however I think I have a good base knowledge to better mess around and code.
I think that is the most important take away from Internet Art. The possibilites are endless. I may even create a nicer, more indepth portfolio given my knowledge. I felt behind a lot in this class
I think this is because of how overwhelmed I was for most of it. Have a good summer, all!
