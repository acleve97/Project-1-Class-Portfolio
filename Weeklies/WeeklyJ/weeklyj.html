 <b>Andrea's Weekly (4/23/23)</b><br>
 Song of the week: 春雷 ( Shunrai / Spring Thunder )- Kenshi Yonezu <br/>
 <br>
Last full week of class is already behind us. Its surreal. I've struggled a lot with this course. It's definitely hard for me to grasp concepts with coding. It's been my first coding course too.
I'm currently finishing up my final project, and getting ready to throw it onto the site later this week. I wanted to make something cool. I still a lot of finals to finish, and some of my things will be
in the final showcase! Hope it goes well.
