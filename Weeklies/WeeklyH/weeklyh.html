 <b>Andrea's Weekly (4/7/23)</b><br>
 Song of the week: Peaches - Jack Black (I had to) <br/>
 <br>
Things are starting to go fast until the end of the semester. We continued working with function, parameters, and iteration from the week prior and exercise 5 will be due soon.
<br>  In my other classes, I made a small podcast episode discussing another podcast, Serial. This weekend I met up with my friends again, and they came down so we could go see the Mario movie. Honestly, who wasn't going to see this movie?
