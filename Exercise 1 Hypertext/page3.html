<br>
<br>
<center><p>In many cultures flowers come to have meanings. In Japanese culture hydrageas have become significant, and many believe the flower originated in Japan.<br>
According to a Japanese legend, the flower became associated with heartful emotions, understanding, and apology. The legend tells a story about an emperor who once gave them to<br>
the family of the girl whom he was in love with as an apology for neglecting her for business. Pink hydrangeas in particular are said to resemble the shape of a beating heart.<br>
</p>
<p>In other cultures and times however, the flower also had more negative associations. In the victorian era, many tied the flower to boastfulness, pride, and vanity.<br>
This is because the hydragea produces little seeds, but many flowers. They were also given to individuals who had turned down a love interests<br>
and this told the reciever that the gifter percieved them as a cold person.</p>

<p> Despite these also negative connotations, I find the Japanese legend and symbolism to be sweeter. Going back to Japanese importance,<br>
the hydrangea's peak season is Japan's rainy season "tsuyu". One of the biggest symbols of the rainy season are hydrangeas.<br>
During this time, Japan holds a plethora of festivals to celebrate the flower. Hydrangeas are also a popular decorative motif.<br>
They make their appearance in Kimono, woodblock prints, paintings, tableware, jewelry, and other home decor accessories. </p></center>
