<center><p> The last page told us about the significance of the Hydrangea, on this page, we're going to talk about Hydrangeas in media.<br>
Because hydrangeas are very popular in Japan, and so is rainy season, you can expect many games with Japanese roots to feature hydrangea themed content.<br>
One of the games I play, Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp, almost always has a rainy season gacha reward in late May or June. Because of them being my favorite flower<br>
I'm always so tempted to make in game purchases to get the items. Going down the list of events in games I was able to find we have: The BanG Dream! Girls Band Party,<br>
Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp, Pikmin Bloom, and a screenshot of what looks to be a hydrangea themed character from Cookie Run. </p></center>
