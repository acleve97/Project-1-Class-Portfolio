<h4 style="color: rgb(182, 117, 212);">Hydrangea macrophylla</h4>
<br>
<p>The hydrangea, also called the <b>hortensia</b>, is one of many of my favorite flowers. <br> 
    Hydragea is also a genus of over 75 to 100 different plants that are native to Asia and the Americas.<br>
    However, Asia is home to larger amount of species diversity. Notable locations are China, Japan, and Korea.<br></p>

<p>Hydrangeas are either deciduous or evergreen, and the most cultivated species are decidious in  nature.<br>
The cultivars (most common cultivated flowers) types of hydrangeas are divided into two groups, Mopheads being the most notable.<br>
In some members of the species, H. macrophylla to be exact, the petals can vary in color due to soil acidity. So while you have seen<br>
pink or purple hydrangeas, blue is able to be seen in a more acidic soil. Most commonly the petals are white. Growing up my family had a large row of hydrangea bushes alongside<br>
our house, all of which's petals where pink. The blue coloring is my personal favorite!<br>

<p>The hydrangea mainly flowers in Spring and Summer, and sometimes, but rarely, Autumn.</p>
